                    I attended Purdue University for its competitive Computer Science and Robotics programs.
                    My experience at Purdue Univesity was enriching both professionally and personally.
                    I took rigorous courses and met lifelong friends, which enabled me to get to where

                    I decided to study abroad at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia

                                    National Fluid Power Association Fluid Power Vehicle Challenge. I worked with a group of
                                    4 students as the subteam in charge of designing, building, and programming the electronics
                                    for the bike which would monitor the hydraulic and pneumatic systems and display the data
                                    on an HMI.

                                    I joined the Boiler Robotics Club (BRC) because of my interest in learning more 
                                    about how robotic arms are made, programmed, and used in a real worlds scenario.
                                    BRC is largely ran by students to design and construct a Mars rover for the 
                                    University Rover Challenge (URC). I worked in a team of 5-6 students to build and 
                                    program the robotic arm of the rover we were making, which would be used for retrieval
                                    and servicing in URC. I used Python, Robotic Operating System (ROS), and solidworks 
                                    while working in this club.
